GIS.lab Web is separated project from the core GIS.lab system with aim 
to produce generally usable QGIS web interface, usable with or without GIS.lab 
infrastructure. In other words, it is infrastructure for publishing QGIS 
projects in web. 

It provides responsive web design, legend, identification possibilities. 
It allows creating topics from layers list, adding base and overlay layers, 
attribute table data filtering, measuring coordinates, length or area

An integral part of whole mechanism is **GIS.lab Web plugin** in QGIS. 
On the ground that GIS.lab Web is currently still in process of development, 
there are no released packages yet. However, installation is possible. 
Above environment can be installed in virtual machine using **Vagrant**.
Vagrant will automatically install whole development environment and build 
GIS.lab Web from source code.ï»¿
Following subsections give a detailed insight into whole mechanism.
