You may be coming to :ref:`GIS.lab <about>` from various operating systems, 
but we expect that you are probably 
familiar with browsing the web, writing documents, sending emails and doing other 
jobrelated tasks with your computer. Whether you are somewhat experienced or 
completely new to computers, this documentation should be very useful for you.
Of course, the more experience you have, the more quickly you will learn. 

In general, this documentation does not assume any computer experience on your 
part. We try to explain in detail what :ref:`GIS.lab Desktop<gislab>`, 
:ref:`GIS.lab Web <gislab-web>` and GIS.lab Mobile are. 
We even tell you how to install 
and how to use every of these pieces in the most efficient way.
